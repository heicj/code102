#TIL
- learned about types in JS, ie number, string, boolean, function
- learned about operators +, -, *, /, % (returns remainder after div)
- using + with strings concatenates
- math x, -, *, /, %
- comparison <,>, ==, ===, <=,>=
- = assigns value
- == is a comparison operator
- === strict equals which compares value and type
- == compares just the value and not the type
- undefined is the default value is JS for variable
